We consider a symmetric monoidal category \(\cat{C}\) with feedback \(\fbk \colon \cat{C}(A \tensor \delay S, B \tensor S) \to \cat{C}(A,B) \), where \(\delay \colon \cat{C} \to \cat{C}\) is a faithful strict monoidal endofunctor on \(\cat{C}\) that preserves feedback (it is a feedback functor).
We think of \(\cat{C}\) as the category of 'actions' or 'things that happen'.
The category \(\Game{\cat{C}}\) then gives the actions that can happen depending on a choice of a parameter (which we think of as strategy or policy).
