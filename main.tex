\title{Open games on categories with feedback}
\author{Elena Di Lavore and Mario Rom\'an}
\begin{document}
\maketitle
\section{Introduction}
\emph{Disclaimer.} This is a very preliminary draft and all the references are missing (as well as some proofs). This work is based on Jules Hedges' open games and categories with feedback as in Katis, Sabadini and Walters (as well as our previous work on them).

We want to extend the construction of open games to any category with feedback \(\cat{C}\).
